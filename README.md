# PythonMiniProjects
This reportisory contains re-challenged mini projects from @ozcanyarimdunya 's python_mini_projeler reportisory. I have only took project ideas, but some of code can be the same. His reportisory in Turkish so, this reportisory will help someone who don't know Turkish. That reportisory's codes are tested on Ubuntu, this one's will be tested on Windows.
